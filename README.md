# Etyl [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Harium/etyl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Harium/etyl) [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/4fe7372ce73741bf9955eb133e05e85b)](https://www.codacy.com/app/yuripourre/etyl?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=Harium/etyl&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

Etyl is the newest version of [Etyllica](https://github.com/etyllica/etyllica) (a 2D Game Engine made in Java).

The project was modified to be a framework over AWT or LibGDX, so you can run the exactly *SAME* code in Desktop or Android (and possibly HTML5 and iOS in the future, thanks to LibGDX).
